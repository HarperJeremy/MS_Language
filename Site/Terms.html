        </p>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to a final and non-appealable judgment by a court or arbitral authority of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of these Terms and Conditions shall remain in full force and effect without regard to such invalid or unenforceable provision.</p>
            <p>
          <strong>Arbitration; Waiver of Jury Trial</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Any dispute, controversy or claim between you and us (including without limitation, any of our any affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees or other representatives) of any type or kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) the Site or any linked site; (b) these Terms and Conditions, including without limitation, any dispute or controversy over the scope or validity of this agreement to arbitrate disputes; (c) any relationship resulting from these Terms and Conditions or the Site; or (d) any breach of these Terms and Conditions; whether based on statute, contract, tort or any other legal theory (including, without limitation, claims of fraud, suppression, misrepresentation and fraud in the inducement), and whether now existing or arising in the future (collectively, a "Claim") shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). You and we agree that your access to and use of this Site and/or any linked site as well as these Terms and Conditions and this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving or affecting interstate "commerce" under the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1, et seq.). You agree that any such Claim will be settled on an individual (non-class) basis by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any dispute regarding whether a particular controversy is subject to arbitration will be decided by the arbitrator. Each of the parties to this contract voluntarily and knowingly waives any right to a trial by jury with respect to any such Claim.</p>
        <p>The arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney having at least ten (10) years experience as a practicing attorney and/or judge. The arbitration award shall be based on substantial evidence, and the arbitrator shall award only such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could properly award under applicable law (including attorneys fees if allowed by applicable law or agreement) and may award to the prevailing party all pre- and post-award expenses of arbitration. All statutes of limitation, defenses and attorney-client or other privileges that would apply in a court proceeding will apply in the arbitration. Any claims by or on behalf of other persons will not be considered in or consolidated with any arbitration proceedings between you and us. This agreement to arbitrate does not limit the right of you or us, whether before, during or after the commencement of any arbitration proceeding, to exercise any self-help remedies such as setoff, or to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies and injunctive or other traditional equitable relief, other than a stay of arbitration, to protect the rights or property of the party seeking such relief. Such judicial relief may take the form of a lawsuit against either party. The taking of any such action shall not constitute a waiver of the rights of either party to compel arbitration regarding any Claim. This agreement to arbitrate disputes will survive your access to this Site or any linked site.</p>
